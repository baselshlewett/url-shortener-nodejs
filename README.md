# url-shortener-nodejs
A POC for a url shortener backend built with nodejs

## Start dev server

### run `npm run dev` to start dev server, it is set to start at port *:3000

You can change the port config in `src/app.ts` and also in .env file the BASE_URL entry so the generated short links can be changed to point to the correct host.
